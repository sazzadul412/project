Prepare main  server

1.Setup ec2 instance
2.Setup hostname
3.Create sadmin user
4.Add user to sudoers file
5.Enable password based login
6.Generate ssh keys
7.Install ansable


1.Become a root user   --> sudo su -
2  Change hostname  -->  vi /etc/hostname
3  sudo systemctl reboot   
4 Create a user sadmin ===  adduser  sadmin
5 Passwd  sadmin123===== passwd sadmin
6 Add sadmin ti this file --->vi /etc/sudoers or visudo

sadmin   ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD:  ALL


7 Change passwordauthentication no to yes --> sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config







8 sudo service sshd reload

su - sadmin

9 Switch to sadminssh-keygen

su - sadmin

10 ssh-keygen(should be in the sadmin user)







Cd .ssh
We can see  2 files there

11 install ansible (see in the notes)




Prepare managed nodes

Setup ec2 instance
Setup hostname
Create sadmin user
Add user to sudoers file
Enable password based login


Adding managed nodes to ansible

In the main server
ssh-copy-id sadmin@private ipaddress of managed node


Ansible performs remote configuration by reading information
from a file called inventory file.The default inventory file is
present in /etc/ansible/hosts.
In this file we should define the ip adress of all the managed hosts that we want ansible to control

sudo vim   /etc/ansible/hosts


Go into insert mode by pressing i
Enter the ip adresses of all the managed hosts
192.168.60.12
192.168.60.13
192.168.60.14
192.168.60.15
Save and quit(Esc :wq!)

Test 

ansible all -m setup 	: gives complete info about nodes
ansible all -m ping	: gives the connection response








ansible all  -a  'ls  -la'    ( you will get the list of the files in all managed nodes )
