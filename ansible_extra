Method 3: Install Ansible on Amazon Linux 2 using pip
Well if you see Ansible’s official installation instructions, it recommends installing it using pip – a package manager for Python packages.

And shall I tell you? Ansible is built on Python or written in Python.

1. Install Python 3

sudo yum install python3
2. Search for pip in yum

yum search pip
3. Install pip3

sudo yum install python3-pip
4. Check pip version

pip3 --version
5. Install Ansible using pip

pip install ansible
lnstall ansible using pip
As you can see pip installed Ansible 2.11.12. Which is quite the latest version. Also, the deprecation warning says to use Python 3.8 or more.

You can install Python 3.8 using

sudo amazon-linux-extras install python3.8
Step 5: Verify Ansible Installation
No matter which method you have used to install Ansible on your Linux 2 EC2 instance. You can verify your Ansible installation using the below command-

ansible --version
